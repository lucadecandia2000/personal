/*
Write a C++ program for simulating the control of an elevator in a building of two floors, according to the 
following man requirements: 
 - the elevator can be called by a person from ground floor (= floor 0), from floor 1 or from floor 
 2: when it is called from a floor different from the one the elevator is currently waiting, it 
 should firstly move to that floor to pick the person up; 
 - once arrived at the calling floor, the elevator will receive an order to go to a different floor 
 (make it random but consistent with its current status, i.e. if elevator is at floor 2, request 
 should be for 0 or 1). 
The following simplifications are allowed: 
 -elevatorâ€™s trip time is assumed to be constant (set it to 2 seconds); 
 -elevator has no memory: it will not queue requests that it cannot serve, which are discarded 
 (it is equivalent to a person taking the stairs if elevator is busy); 
 -new requests to the elevator arrive between 1 and 3 seconds; 
 -simulation runs for 30 seconds; 
The function to put a thread in the sleep status (e.g., for 1 second) is the following 
on  e: std::this_thread::sleep_for (std::chrono::seconds(1)) 
Write the code of the program and manage threads synchronization. 
Make sure all threads finish running before the main program terminates.
